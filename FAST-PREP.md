## üíª Live Coding Interview Preparation

Interviewers look for problem-solving skills, clean code, communication, and knowledge of the chosen language/framework.

### Common Live Coding Problem Categories:

1.  **UI Component Building (Stateless & Stateful):**
    - Examples: Modal, Tabs, Accordion, Star Rating, Autocomplete Input, Image Carousel.
    - Focus: Props, state management (e.g., `useState`), event handling, basic styling, accessibility considerations. Typed props/state if using TypeScript.
2.  **State Management & Hooks:**
    - Examples: Typed Form with `useState`/`useReducer` and validation, data fetching with `useEffect`/`useState` (handle loading/error states), custom hooks (e.g., `useToggle`, `useDebounce`, `useLocalStorage`, `useFetch`).
    - Focus: Logic, hook usage, side effects, reusability, TypeScript generics if applicable.
3.  **List Rendering & Manipulation:**
    - Examples: Filterable list, sortable list, paginated list, simple shopping cart.
    - Focus: Array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`), managing collections of data, keys.
4.  **API Interaction & Asynchronous Operations:**
    - Examples: Fetch data from a public API and display it, implement a simple search that calls an API, handle form submission to a mock API.
    - Focus: Promises, `async/await`, error handling, loading states.
5.  **JavaScript/Algorithm Challenges (often framework-agnostic but can be integrated):**
    - Examples: Debounce/Throttle implementation, flatten an array, find common elements, simple string/array manipulations.
    - Focus: Core JavaScript logic, efficiency.
6.  **CSS Challenges (less common for full live coding, but can be part of UI building):**
    - Examples: Center an element, create a specific layout (e.g., holy grail), responsive card.

### Tips for Live Coding:

- **Understand & Clarify:** Ask questions to ensure you understand the requirements.
- **Verbalize Your Thoughts:** Explain your approach before and during coding.
- **Start Simple:** Get a basic version working, then iterate and add complexity.
- **Write Clean Code:** Use meaningful variable names, keep functions small.
- **Test Incrementally:** Check your progress frequently.
- **Handle Edge Cases:** Think about what could go wrong (e.g., empty inputs, API errors).
- **If using TypeScript:** Define types/interfaces for props, state, and important data structures early.
- **Don't Panic:** If you get stuck, explain what you're thinking. Interviewers are often interested in your problem-solving process.

Good luck with your preparation!
