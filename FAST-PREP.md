## üíª Common Live Coding Problem Areas (React & TypeScript)

Focus on your thought process, communication, and breaking down the problem.

1.  **UI Component Building:**
    - **Typed Counter:** Props for initial count/step, state for current count, increment/decrement functions.
    - **Typed Toggle/Switch:** Props for state and callback, internal state management.
    - **Character Counter Input:** Props for max length, state for input value, display count.
    - **Simple Tabs Component:** Props for tab data (id, title, content), state for active tab.
2.  **State Management & Hooks:**
    - **Typed Form with `useState` and Basic Validation:** Manage form state object, handle input changes, basic validation logic.
    - **Data Fetching with `useEffect`/`useState`:** Fetch from a public API, define types for response, handle loading/error states.
    - **Custom Hook (e.g., `useToggle`, `useDebounce`, `useLocalStorage`):** Implement a reusable hook with proper typing (generics if applicable).
3.  **List Rendering & Manipulation:**
    - **Filterable List:** Given an array of typed objects, render a list and an input field to filter the list client-side.
4.  **API Interaction:**
    - **Paginated Data Table:** Fetch and display paginated data, handle page navigation. Define types for API response and items.

**Remember for Live Coding:**

- Clearly state your understanding of the problem and ask clarifying questions.
- Define types/interfaces for props, state, and important data structures early.
- Explain your approach before and while coding.
- Handle basic edge cases and error states.
- Think about accessibility and performance if prompted or relevant.
- Test your component conceptually or with simple manual interactions.

This list should provide a solid foundation for your interview preparation!
