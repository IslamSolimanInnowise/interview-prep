- **What are arrow functions (ES6)?** What are their key characteristics and differences from traditional functions (e.g., lexical `this` binding, no `arguments` object, cannot be used as constructors)?
- **What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?** Explain how its value is determined in different contexts:
  - Global context (window in browsers, or `undefined` in strict mode modules).
  - Function context (simple call - value depends on strict mode).
  - As a method of an object (`this` refers to the object).
  - With the `new` keyword (constructor call - `this` refers to the newly created instance).
  - With `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` (how they explicitly set `this`).
  - In arrow functions (`this` is lexically inherited from the surrounding scope).
  - In DOM event handlers (`this` typically refers to the element that triggered the event, unless an arrow function is used as the handler).
- **Explain scope in JavaScript.** Define global scope, function (local) scope, and block scope (introduced by `let` and `const`).
- What is lexical (or static) scope? (Scope is determined by where variables/functions are declared during authoring time).
- **What are closures?** Explain how they work with an example. Why are they useful (e.g., data privacy/encapsulation, partial application, callbacks, remembering state)?
- What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)? What are its use cases (e.g., avoiding global scope pollution, creating private scope)?
- **What are objects in JavaScript?** How do you create objects (object literal, constructor functions, `Object.create()`, ES6 classes - focus on literals and constructors/classes)?
- How do you access, add, modify, and delete properties of an object? (dot notation vs. bracket notation - when to use bracket notation).

- What is the ES6 `class` syntax? Is it just syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance? Explain `constructor`, methods, `super` (for inheritance).
- How can you check if an object has a specific property? (`in` operator, `hasOwnProperty()`).
- What are common ways to iterate over an object's properties? (`for...in` loop - iterates over enumerable properties including inherited ones; `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()` - iterate over own enumerable properties).

- **What are Hooks in React?** Why were they introduced? What problems do they solve (allow using state and other React features in functional components)?
- **What are the "Rules of Hooks"?** (Only call Hooks at the top level, only call Hooks from React functions). Why are these rules important (to ensure hooks are called in the same order on every render)?
- **Explain the `useState()` Hook.** How do you update state with it? Does `setState` (from `useState`) update state synchronously or asynchronously (asynchronously, batched for performance)?
- **Explain the `useEffect()` Hook.**

- Explain the `useCallback()` Hook (Mid+). What problem does it solve (memoizing callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that rely on referential equality of props)? How does it relate to referential equality and performance optimization (e.g., with `React.memo`)?
- Explain the `useMemo()` Hook (Mid+). What problem does it solve (memoizing expensive computations so they are not re-calculated on every render)? How does it differ from `useCallback` (`useCallback` memoizes functions, `useMemo` memoizes values)?
- Explain the `useRef()` Hook. What are its common use cases (accessing DOM elements, storing mutable values that don't trigger re-renders)? How is it different from `createRef()` (used in class components or for refs not tied to component lifecycle)?
- What are Custom Hooks? Why are they powerful (reusing stateful logic)? How do you create one? Provide a simple example (e.g., `useToggle`, `useFormInput`).
- What is `React.memo()`? How does it work for optimizing functional components (shallow comparison of props)? How does it compare to `PureComponent` for class components?
- What are Error Boundaries? How do they work (using class components with `componentDidCatch` or `static getDerivedStateFromError` to catch JS errors in their child component tree), and why are they important for robust applications? Can a functional component be an error boundary directly (no, but you can use a class component wrapper or a library)?

  - What is a Git branch? Why are branches useful in a team environment (working on features/bugs in isolation)?
  - What is `git merge`? What are merge conflicts and how do you resolve them (manually editing files to choose correct changes)?
  - Explain a common Git workflow (e.g., create a feature branch, make commits, push, create a Pull Request/Merge Request for review and merging into main/develop).
  - What is `.gitignore` file used for?
  - What are pull requests (PRs) or merge requests (MRs)? (A way to propose changes and have them reviewed before merging).
- **Developer Tools (Browser & Framework-specific):**
  - How do you use browser developer tools effectively for debugging and development?
    - Elements/Inspector panel (inspecting/modifying DOM and CSS).
    - Console panel (logging messages, errors, interacting with JS).
    - Sources panel (debugging JS, setting breakpoints, stepping through code - Mid+).
    - Network panel (analyzing network requests, checking status codes, response payloads - basic usage).
  - What are React DevTools or similar tools for other frameworks? How do they help in debugging component hierarchy, state, and props?
  - What are source maps? Why are they useful for debugging transpiled code (they map compiled code back to original source)?
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment/Delivery) (Awareness for Mid+):**
  - What is CI/CD (conceptual: automating build, test, deployment)? What are its benefits (faster releases, better quality)?

## XIII. Live Coding Questions üíª

This section lists common problem areas for live coding interviews for these levels, typically involving React and basic TypeScript if applicable.

- **UI Component Implementation (Stateless & Stateful) using React:**
  - **Typed Counter:** Props: `initialCount?: number`. State: current count. Func: Increment, Decrement buttons.
  - **Typed Toggle/Switch:** Props: `isOn: boolean`, `onToggle: (newState: boolean) => void`. Func: Clicking toggles its state.
  - **Character Counter Input:** Props: `maxLength: number`. Display: "X/Y characters".
  - **Basic Tabs Component:** Props: `tabs: Array<{ title: string; content: string | React.ReactNode }>`. State: Active tab ID. Func: Clicking a tab displays its content.
  - **Simple Star Rating (display only or basic interaction):** Props: `rating: number`. Func: Visually represents rating.
  - **Simple Image Carousel (Next/Previous buttons, no complex features):** Props: `images: Array<string (url)>`. State: Current image index.
  - **Basic Progress Bar:** Props: `percentage: number`. Visually represents percentage.
  - **Basic Modal/Dialog (focus on rendering/closing, less on advanced a11y for junior):** Props: `isOpen: boolean`, `onClose: () => void`.
  - **Simple Accordion (one item open at a time).**
  - **Todo List (Add item, display list. Bonus: remove item, toggle complete - for Junior+/Mid).**
- **State Management & Hooks (with TypeScript if applicable):**
  - **Simple Form with `useState`:** Few input fields, controlled components, display submitted data. Basic client-side validation (e.g., required field).
  - **Data Fetching with `useEffect`, `useState`:** Fetch data from a public API (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`). Define a simple `interface` or `type` for the expected API response structure (if TS). Handle loading and display data or error message.
  - **Custom Hook: `useToggle(initialValue: boolean): [boolean, () => void]` (simple version).**
  - **(Mid+) Custom Hook: `useLocalStorage<T>(key: string, initialValue: T): [T, (value: T | ((val: T) => T)) => void]` (simpler version without advanced error handling).**
  - **(Mid+) Custom Hook: `useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number): T` (understanding the concept and basic implementation).**
- **JavaScript/Algorithm Challenges (Frontend Flavored):**
  - Reverse a string.
  - Check if a string is a palindrome.
  - Find the most frequent character in a string / Count characters in a string.
  - Flatten a simple nested array (e.g., one or two levels deep).
  - Remove duplicates from an array.
  - FizzBuzz problem.
  - Sum all numbers in an array.
  - Filter an array based on a condition.
- **CSS Challenges (Less common for extensive live coding, more for discussion or small snippets):**
  - Recreate a simple layout (e.g., a card, a header with logo and nav).
  - Center an element horizontally and vertically using Flexbox.
- **React Specific:**
  - Manage state for a small interactive component.
  - Pass data from a parent to a child component using props.
  - Call a parent function from a child component (callback props).

## XIV. Behavioral & Situational Questions ü§î

These questions assess soft skills, problem-solving approach, teamwork, and experience, relevant for all these levels.

- Tell me about a challenging project you worked on (can be personal, academic, or professional if applicable). What were the challenges, and how did you overcome them?
- Describe a time you had a conflict with a team member or classmate. How did you resolve it (or attempt to)?
- How do you stay updated with new technologies and trends in frontend development? What are you learning currently?
- Tell me about a time you made a mistake or failed at something. What did you learn from it?
- How do you handle tight deadlines or pressure (if experienced, otherwise how you imagine you would)?
- How do you approach debugging an issue in your code? Describe your thought process.
- What are your strengths as a developer (or aspiring developer)? What is an area you'd like to improve or learn more about?
- Why are you interested in this role/company? (Do your research!).
- Where do you see yourself in 3-5 years? / What are your career goals in frontend development?
- How do you contribute to code reviews (if experienced, or how would you approach it)? What do you look for when reviewing someone else's code, or what kind of feedback do you find helpful?
- Describe your experience working in an Agile/Scrum environment (if any, otherwise conceptual understanding).
- How do you prioritize tasks when you have multiple things to do?
- How do you approach learning new technologies or programming concepts?
- How do you collaborate with others in a team (developers, designers, product managers - if experienced, otherwise how you prefer to)?
- How do you handle feedback, especially constructive criticism?
- Imagine you're starting a new project/task. What questions would you ask to understand the requirements better?
- How do you contribute to a positive and productive team environment?
