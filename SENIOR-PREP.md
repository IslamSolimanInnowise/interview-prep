This section explores software design patterns applicable to frontend and React, as well as code refactoring principles.

### Design Patterns

- **General:**
  - What are design patterns? Why are they useful in software development?
  - Can you name a few common JavaScript design patterns? (e.g., Module, Singleton, Observer/Pub-Sub, Factory, Facade, Proxy, Decorator, Command). Explain one or two.
  - How do design patterns help in creating maintainable, scalable, and reusable code?
- **React Specific:**
  - What are common React design patterns?
    - **Higher-Order Components (HOCs):** What are they? Use cases? Potential issues (prop collisions, wrapper hell)?
    - **Render Props:** How do they work? Use cases for sharing logic?
    - **Custom Hooks:** How are they a pattern for reusing stateful logic?
    - **Compound Components:** Explain the pattern and provide an example (e.g., a Tabs or Select component).
    - **Provider Pattern (Context API):** How is it used for dependency injection or global state?
    - **Container/Presentational Components (Smart/Dumb Components):** Though less emphasized with Hooks, what was the idea? How do Hooks blur this line?
  - How do Hooks change the way we use some traditional React patterns (e.g., replacing HOCs or Render Props in many cases)?
  - Discuss the pros and cons of different patterns for solving specific problems (e.g., sharing logic between components, managing complex state).
- **Architect Level:**
  - How do architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, MVVM, Flux/Redux, Micro Frontends, Atomic Design) influence frontend development and React architectures?
  - How do you choose appropriate design patterns for a given problem considering scalability, maintainability, team familiarity, and performance?
  - Discuss patterns for managing cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, error handling, internationalization) in a large React application.

### Refactoring

- What is code refactoring? Why is it important for the health of a codebase?
- When should you refactor code? What are common "code smells" that indicate a need for refactoring? (e.g., duplicated code, long methods/components, large classes, excessive comments, tight coupling).
- Describe some refactoring techniques you have used (e.g., Extract Method/Component, Introduce Parameter Object, Encapsulate Field, Rename Variable/Function).
- How do you refactor a large legacy codebase safely without introducing regressions? (Incremental changes, good test coverage).
- How does strong test coverage support and enable effective refactoring?
- How do you balance the need for refactoring with ongoing feature development and deadlines?
- (Architect Level) How do you lead a team effort in large-scale refactoring? What strategies and tools would you use? What metrics can be used to track progress and success of refactoring efforts?
- (Architect Level) Discuss refactoring towards specific architectural goals, such as improving modularity, testability, or performance.

- **What is Jest?** What is it primarily used for in the React ecosystem? (Test runner, assertion library, mocking).
- **What is React Testing Library (RTL)?** What is its core philosophy ("The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.")? How does it encourage testing behavior over implementation details?
- How do you write a simple unit test for a React component using Jest and RTL? (Rendering the component, basic queries, simple assertions).
- What are "matchers" in Jest? Give examples (e.g., `toBe`, `toEqual`, `toBeTruthy`, `toHaveBeenCalled`).

- **How do you test custom Hooks?** (Using `@testing-library/react-hooks` or `@testing-library/react`'s `renderHook`).
- **What is code coverage?** How do you interpret it? Is 100% coverage always the goal? Why or why not?
- **How do you simulate user events** (e.g., clicks, input changes, form submissions) with RTL and `@testing-library/user-event`?
- What is the difference between `getBy*`, `queryBy*`, and `findBy*` queries in RTL? When to use each?

## XIII. Live Coding Questions üíª

This section lists common problem areas for live coding interviews, typically involving React and TypeScript.

### Example Problem Areas & Components

- **UI Component Implementation (Stateless & Stateful):**
  - **Typed Counter:** Props: `initialCount?: number`, `step?: number`. State: current count. Func: Increment, Decrement. Variations: Reset, min/max, input field.
  - **Typed Toggle/Switch:** Props: `isOn: boolean`, `onToggle: (newState: boolean) => void`, `label?: string`. Func: Clicking toggles state. Variations: Style like UI switch, disabled state.
  - **Character Counter Input:** Props: `maxLength: number`. Display: "X/Y characters". Variations: Visual feedback, prevent typing past max.
  - **Typed Tabs Component:** Props: `tabs: Array<{ id: string | number; title: string; content: React.ReactNode }>`. State: Active tab ID. Func: Clicking a tab displays its content. Variations: Active tab styling, keyboard navigation.
  - **Typed Star Rating:** Props: `count?: number`, `rating: number`, `onRatingChange?: (newRating: number) => void`. Func: Clicking a star sets rating. Variations: Hover effect, half-stars.
  - **Simple Image Carousel:** Props: `images: Array<{ src: string; alt: string }>`. State: Current image index. Func: Next/Previous buttons. Variations: Dot indicators, autoplay.
  - **Typed Progress Bar:** Props: `percentage: number`, `label?: string`. Func: Visually represents percentage. Variations: Animation, text display.
  - **Accessible Tooltip Component:** Props: `content: React.ReactNode`. Func: Wraps children, appears on hover/focus. A11y: Keyboard accessible, ARIA attributes.
  - **Breadcrumbs Component:** Props: `items: Array<{ label: string; href?: string }>`.
  - **Notification/Alert Component:** Props: `message: string`, `type: 'success' | 'error' | 'warning' | 'info'`, `onClose?: () => void`. Variations: Dismiss button, auto-dismiss.
  - **Build a Modal/Dialog:** Ensure accessibility (focus trapping, keyboard close).
  - **Implement a simple Accordion.**
- **State Management & Hooks (with TypeScript):**
  - **Typed Form with `useState` and Basic Validation:** Fields like name, email, age. Controlled inputs, submit handler, display inline errors.
  - **Data Fetching with `useEffect`, `useState`, Typed Responses:** Fetch from public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder). Define interface/type for response. Handle loading/error states.
  - **`useContext` for Typed Global State:** E.g., User Profile (`{ id, username, theme }`). Provide, consume, update theme.
  - **`useReducer` for Complex State Management:** E.g., Typed Todo List (`{ id, text, completed }`). Define types for actions and reducer.
  - **Custom Hook: `useToggle(initialValue: boolean): [boolean, () => void]`**.
  - **Custom Hook: `useLocalStorage<T>(key: string, initialValue: T): [T, Setter<T>]`**. Handle `JSON.stringify/parse`.
  - **Custom Hook: `useDebounce<T>(value: T, delay: number): T`**.
  - **Custom Hook: `useFetch<T>(url: string, options?: RequestInit)`**. Generic, handles loading/error, provides `refetch`.
  - **Custom Hook: `useForm<T>(initialValues: T)`**. Basic generic form handling.
- **JavaScript/Algorithm Challenges (Frontend Flavored):**
  - Implement `throttle`.
  - Handle nested comments rendering.
  - Write a function to deeply compare two objects/arrays.
  - Implement a simple search/filter functionality on a list of data.
  - Flatten an array of objects.
  - Client-side data transformation for rendering.
- **CSS Challenges:**
  - Recreate a simple layout (e.g., a card, a header).
  - Center an element in various ways.
  - Implement a responsive grid.
- **React Specific:**
  - Refactor a class component to a functional component with Hooks.
  - Manage state for a small application.
  - Pass data between components (parent-child, child-parent, sibling-sibling).

### Tips for Live Coding

- **Think Aloud:** Explain your approach and thought process. This is often more important than the perfect solution.
- **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Make sure you understand the requirements and constraints before diving in.
- **Start Simple:** Get a basic version working, then iterate and add complexity or features.
- **Write Clean Code:** Pay attention to variable naming, function/component structure, and overall readability.
- **Test Your Code:** Even simple manual tests in the browser or `console.log` statements can help verify functionality.
- **Handle Edge Cases (if time allows or prompted):** Think about what could go wrong or how the component might be misused.
- **Communicate:** If you get stuck, explain what you're trying to do and where you're facing difficulty. The interviewer might offer a hint.
- **TypeScript Specific:** Define types for props, state, and function signatures. Use generics where appropriate. Avoid `any` if possible; use `unknown` as a safer alternative if needed temporarily.
