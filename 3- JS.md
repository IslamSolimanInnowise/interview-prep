---

This expanded list should serve as a very robust preparation guide. Remember that for any question, especially for mid to senior roles, the interviewer is often more interested in your thought process, your ability to discuss trade-offs, and your understanding of _why_ things work the way they do, rather than just a superficial definition. Good luck!
