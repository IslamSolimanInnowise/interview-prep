## üìå Bonus: Basic CSS Reset/Boilerplate Discussion

An interviewer might show you a basic CSS reset or ask you to write one and explain its purpose and common inclusions. Your example is a good starting point for a reset combined with base styles.

```css
/* A more minimal Reset Example */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Often a preferred default */
}

/* Optional: Remove list styles on ul, ol elements with a list role, which suggests they are for navigation or similar */
ul[role="list"],
ol[role="list"] {
  list-style: none;
}

/* Optional: Make images easier to work with */
img,
picture,
video,
canvas,
svg {
  display: block; /* Remove bottom space under images */
  max-width: 100%; /* Make images responsive by default */
}

/* Optional: Inherit fonts for inputs and buttons */
input,
button,
textarea,
select {
  font: inherit;
}

/* Optional: Basic body defaults (could be part of a separate base styles file) */
body {
  min-height: 100vh; /* Ensure body takes at least full viewport height */
  line-height: 1.5; /* A common baseline for readability */
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; /* Improve font rendering on WebKit */
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale; /* Improve font rendering on Firefox (macOS) */
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto,
    Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, "Open Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif; /* Modern font stack */
}

/* Further base styles like in your example would follow (typography, links, etc.) */

h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  /* Example: remove default browser margins or set them consistently */
  /* Consider text-wrap: balance; for headings for better visual balance (newer property) */
  /* text-wrap: balance; */
}

a {
  /* text-decoration: none; (if globally removing underlines) */
  /* color: inherit; (if links should inherit color by default) */
}
```
