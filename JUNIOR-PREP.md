- What is the `children` prop? How is it used (e.g., `<WrapperComponent>Children go here</WrapperComponent>`)?
- Explain the `useEffect` Hook.
  - What are its common use cases for side effects (e.g., data fetching after render, setting up subscriptions, manually changing the DOM)?
  - What is the dependency array (`[]`, `[dep1, dep2]`, or no array)? How does it control when the effect runs?
    - `[]`: Runs once after the initial render.
    - `[dep1, dep2]`: Runs after the initial render and whenever `dep1` or `dep2` changes.
    - No array: Runs after every render (use with caution).
  - How do you perform a cleanup in `useEffect` (by returning a function from the effect)? When does this cleanup function run (before the component unmounts, or before the effect runs again if dependencies changed)?
- How do you fetch data in a React component? (Typically using `useEffect` to trigger the fetch and `useState` to store the data, loading state, and error state).
- What are controlled components in forms? (Input form element whose value is controlled by React state). How do you implement one with `useState` and an `onChange` handler?

- How do you create dynamic routes in Next.js? (e.g., `pages/posts/[id].js` or `app/posts/[id]/page.js`).

For junior levels, live coding questions usually focus on fundamentals and simple component building.

- **UI Component Implementation (React):**
  - Build a simple Counter component (with increment/decrement buttons, displaying the count).
  - Build a Toggle/Switch component (displays "ON"/"OFF" or changes style based on a boolean state).
  - Create an input field that updates a piece of state as the user types, and display the typed text elsewhere on the page.
  - Render a list of items (e.g., strings from an array) as `<li>` elements.
  - Conditionally render a message if a certain condition (e.g., a boolean state variable) is true.
- **JavaScript Fundamentals:**
  - Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns their sum.
  - Write a function that reverses a given string.
  - Write a function that filters an array to only include even numbers.
  - FizzBuzz: Loop from 1 to 100. Print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both. Otherwise, print the number.
- **HTML/CSS (Less common for live coding, but possible):**
  - Create the HTML structure for a simple card component (e.g., image, title, description).
  - Write CSS to style a simple button or center an element on the page.

**Tips for Junior Live Coding:**

- **Think Aloud:** Explain what you are trying to do.
- **Ask Clarifying Questions:** If the problem isn't clear, ask.
- **Start with the Simplest Working Solution:** Get something basic on the screen, then improve it.
- **Syntax is Okay to Forget (a little):** Interviewers understand you might not remember every exact piece of syntax under pressure, especially for very junior roles. Focus on the logic and concepts. They are more interested in your problem-solving approach.
- **Basic TypeScript:** If the role involves TypeScript, try to add simple type annotations for props and state.

## XIV. Behavioral & Situational Questions ü§î

These questions assess your enthusiasm, learning ability, and how you might fit into a team.

- Why are you interested in frontend development?
- Why are you interested in this role/company?
- How do you like to learn new things?
- Tell me about a project you've worked on (even personal or academic) that you're proud of. What did you do? What did you learn?
- How do you approach a problem you don't know how to solve?
- Do you prefer working alone or in a team? Why?
- What are your strengths? What is an area you'd like to improve? (Be honest but positive).
- Do you have any questions for me/us? (Always prepare a few thoughtful questions about the role, team, company culture, or technologies they use).

This refocused list should be much more manageable for preparing for trainee to junior+ level interviews. Good luck!
